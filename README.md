# Time_domain_response_to_sine
This MATLAB script simulates the time-domain response of an RLC circuit (Resistor, Inductor, and Capacitor) to a sine wave input signal. The transfer function of the RLC circuit is defined, and the output is computed using the lsim function, which simulates the system's behavior.
